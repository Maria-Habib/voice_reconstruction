We stayed in Warsaw at the University of Warsaw. The accommodation was pretty rubbish really compared to what you get in this country. We had three beds in a room. That's one bed and two on the bunk bed so that was pretty dire and it got really hot at times but it was it's very nice place in Russell. We spent a whole day shopping. Prices there are quite cheap compared to England. The main reason we were there was for competition. We were in Poland for only a week and the competition was on two days. So we had a fair bit of time to go around, see the sights and all that. I didn't get much Polish out because it didn't really seem worth learning a lot of it but I learned a few phrases which were useful. What else did we do? Only three people from my college went and about 14 from England because it was an international competition. So we did a fair bit of socialising with people from other countries. At the end of the week, some people had an international football match, which was basically all people from the UK versus everyone else and apparently they lost which sounds fairly plausible. What else to say? They've got really good public transport in Poland because obviously well in Warsaw in particular because after the whole place was bombed in the Second World War they had it completely rebuilt and obviously had the time to think about it so they've got really wide roads on an average road in Walsall you'll get about two or three lanes of traffic and a couple of wide pavements and some tram lines down the middle. And where you haven't got tram lines you've got a grassy patch so you can build tram lines if they want.",

And it's about two teenagers who are striving to go to school to earn some money because they want to go and live in Cornwall, except in the end they don't make it because the mum finds the money which she's been saving and she goes out and buys a new hi-fi and it's based in the 1960s. And I've read for that four or five times and each time I've played quite a big main part. And a week after that I went to get my snake's aquarium and the aquarium was three feet and it was second hand. We bought it off a newspaper, an advert in a newspaper. And a week after that we went to get the snake and I was going to get a garter snake but some friends told us that a corn snake would be much better because they had one themselves and so we bought a corn snake and when they went to get it a man asked me to hold it in the pet shop and it was much bigger than I thought. At first I was quite scared but after I held it, it was okay. The reason why I was scared was because there was about ten people crowding around to watch a man take it out.

We have a good chance of winning the Premier League and the FA Cup. We're in the semi-finals of the FA Cup and we're top of the table in the Premier League. So I think if we just keep winning our games and stay focused, then we have a good chance of winning it. The FA Cup, the other teams that might be a bit of a threat, I think it's Chelsea and Newcastle, if they're in it, I think they have a good chance of winning as well. In the Champions League, Man United got away, but hopefully next year we'll be in it. My favourite player in Arsenal is Thierry Henry. He plays for France and France are a very good team, so I think he's helping Arsenal as well because he's a very experienced player. He's scored the most goals in the Premier League. I don't know about the FA Cup but he has scored a lot of goals for Arsenal so that's why he's my favourite player. My second favourite player is Robert Perez. He's scored quite a few goals but not as much as Thierry Henry but he's still a good player. He also comes from France so another French player who's really good can score. Patrick Vieira who's also from France and Arsenal have many French players he's very good as well but he doesn't really Patrick Vieira doesn't really Patrick Vieira doesn't really score that much goals but he is a good player and he knows how to pass the ball and to help people score.

It's just now and then. Or it's not, or at least I don't write I don't write a large amount of stuff. It's just a rough note which I've gradually accumulated. How long were the courses you took at the college in Manchester? The course in Manchester was for three years and the course have a second degree from the Royal College? And illustrations, is it in graphics? Well, illustration is more concerned with making drawings and images, whereas the graphics tends to be more concerned with the layout. But they overlap a good deal anyway. My main asset is in drawing really, an ability to draw. So illustration seems like the obvious thing to go in for. You paint a lot. Yes, well, I draw more than paint. I'm trying to do more painting recently, well, over the past couple of years because I hadn't really used colour a great studies, who used to do illustrations and drawings. I mean, what are sort of examples for you? drawings of George Gross who uh... Gil Ray, who was an 18th century British illustrator. And Rawlinson, who was working at the same time. I like them. I can't think of many others actually. We're not illustrators, you know, I'm more interested in the painters really than the illustrators. I like David Hockney. I like his drawings. And apart from that, Renaissance painters. Mantegna is one of my favourites. And Piero della Francesca. In fact, I'm more interested in those than in illustrators, really. That's why I don't know much about illustrators. That's why I can't remember. Have you been to the Chag is a bit too jarring. And it was a lovely program. I think one of the things to enjoy Chagall is to be more involved with his way at least part-time teaching in art schools. I don't have that, no. And I haven't actually done any teaching. It's not a thing which I've ever really seriously considered. Can I ask you about your family? Do you have brothers, sisters? Yes, I've got two sisters. One of them lives in Plymouth, where my parents live. The other lives in London. And you are in the middle? No, I'm the eldest. So it's nice to have a sister nearby. Yes. And your parents are working in Plymouth or in Pension now? My father works in Plymouth. Although... Although... He's meant... Although... He's retiring this year. I think he's anyway. He's not quite sure about that. But he's at retiring age. Or near retiring age. So it'll be just this year then then you're just he doesn't want to stay on i think he'll be quite glad to retire and he works in the top five internet here he's connected with that It's a very industrial part of the town, isn't it? Yeah, I remember passing through this town. And your mother used to work at home? And you're not married? And do you know of someone in the family who used to stutter heavy or sort of wait? Since what? Since when did you start speaking? Could it be that it started earlier, but you became have noticed it and would have asked me why I was stammering. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, well, I think in my case, it might have become apparent that it wasn't just a phase but it was continuing. And did it interfere with you doing things that you wished to do? I mean, would you choose another profession or go to study a different thing in college? Well, I think I might have considered going in for teaching, which I've never really considered, because I think that having a speech impediment wouldn used to teach lectures as well. I mean, I had a lecture as well. It was a very good lecture. It was one of but it's a thing which tends to be repeated to a certain extent. It's easier. Because I'm not so bad when I'm reading out things. Although I used to be. I used to hate doing that at school when I had to read out in front of the class. But that's not so bad now. Or maybe it's because it's not a thing which I have to do now. Whereas at the time at school it was a thing which I was expected to do. And so it was the idea that I had to do it.

I chose football as my favourite hobby because it involves some skills that you need to learn. It also helps you keep fit and make your brain work more actively. My other hobbies are cricket rounders because they all involve running and hitting. But my favourite one is Rounders because it has a thin, long bat that is hard to hold up and is thin because it needs to hit harder. The ball is fatter than the bat. Cricket is much nicer because it has a fatter bat and a smaller ball but the bats are heavy and you need to have a lot of strength to hold a bat. You need also to have a hard hitting skills. It also needs you to be a fast runner and a good aimer. Horse riding is also good because you improve on your skills on how to be confident with a horse. You also jump over some poles.",
