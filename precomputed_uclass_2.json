And she said, but look over here, there's a sign saying buy two save ten pounds. So we bought two and we paid to the shop assistant and we walked around the bend and then we got these slips of paper and these red disc and this blue disc. After that we walked out and I found a card in this or book in this trolley and then we ran back home and then after an hour at home we went to see a movie, the Pokemon movie.

Then when it came to breakfast or lunch or supper, we stopped and found a safe place to moor, but sometimes we had to stop at a water junction to get some more water. Then once we have left the water junction, we headed on and then when it was time to have supper we stopped and cooked. Inside the narrowboat the cooking facilities were very good. They had a gas cooker, an oven and a hop which we used quite a lot. We had to bring our own foods since they didn't supply us with food. And then once they'd been cooked, we had some very interesting varieties of food. Then afterwards, we got undressed and used the shower, which was the only form of washing we had.

To have this position, you either have to have a degree or you can have been recommended from other grades of officer. I entered into the civil service in 1971 with eight Old devils and four old devils. I have since worked in about three or four different offices but all in the Birmingham area. It's a fairly interesting job if you like figure work. And the people who I currently deal with are self-employed people such as builders, electricians, bookmakers, then there would be self-employed accountants and teachers, estate agents, solicitors, electricians, taxi drivers, carpet fitters, What are your expectations afterwards? Where do you like to walk exactly after you finish the training course? heard but I do not know exactly where I shall get transferred to. It could be down in London or it could be say Hereford or it could be anywhere. If it was in London the trouble would be the price of housing which is very high. Also I do feel when I come down to London that the pace of life is very fast in comparison to other areas. Although, even though I say that, it is an interesting place from the historical point of view. And when I compare Birmingham with this place, there is no comparison at all. The inner city in Birmingham How old is London? If you have a look at England as a whole, the only cities which have got any real interest are either Edinburgh in Scotland or London. Even though some of these other cities might have a few old churches and town halls and that sort of thing they haven't got a lot else to offer also even if you looked at the these theaters in London there's a lot of theatres. In Birmingham there's only three, which are only very small anyway, in comparison to London. So from the entertainment point of view it is extremely restricted. Birmingham is an industrial city with some large manufacturing industries such as austium rover cars. They also make parts for aeroplanes and extra things which I can't offhand think about. But it is an industrial city. It is an industrial city. Tell me something, I was wondering, what is the process when you catch somebody who didn't pay taxes, broke the law in some extent in your area? What happens to him once he's caught? and we have found them out we will have to ask him if he accepts the figures if he does accept the figures we then go on from there to begin with we would we would then find out how much income tax is due upon that income then he would also be charged a figure of interest upon that tax also he would have to pay a penalty now the penalty alters with the degree of culpability if he has been fraudulent the penalty is a lot higher than if he's only just been neglectful so we charge him the tax some interest upon that and a penalty then and we've got all three he has to make an offer to pay those figures. After he pays the offer, well, after he signs the form, he's got 30 days in which time to actually make the offer. And if he does that, there isn't going to be any further action. Offhand, we would only send people to prison where it was a case of fraud, when they had been very, very bad. And now moving to a very different subject, what",

I'm in all those teams apart from athletics which I don't really like. In rugby I play inside centre which is really kind of a forward but helps at the back as well. Midfield, if you're talking football wise. In football I'm a defender and I play for the school team as well in cricket I'm not really a bowler but I can bowl quite well quite accurately I'm more of a batter and my favourite bat is the V600 by Schlesinger at school my favourite subject is science and I like that because you get to find out a wide variety of things.

But I find at times I tend to become so preoccupied with it that I can't think of anything else but my stammer. This has happened over the last couple of months. And I tend to get... It's as though I'm going around in circles trying to work out what to do. I'm thinking about the next conversation I'm going to make. Is this the kind of thing you're after? Yes, I mean... Yeah? Because usually, I mean, you're the first man I've ever seen, man, woman stutter. And in fact, I think I'm speaking more deliberately and slowly at the moment, but in general, I tend to speak quite quickly apparently. I mean, it doesn't seem quick to me. At the moment, this seems quite slow. I'll probably speak more quickly than this, but I'm perhaps taking time to consider what I'm saying. And people usually in your life, I'm the sort of person who prefers to, if I was doing some work, for example, writing an essay or whatever, I'd need complete quiet. Something like this place right at the moment. You know, and there's some people apparently who can work, you know, with Radio 1 on, with the Top 20 or cassette music, but, you know, I like quiet, so I thought that might, you know, be a... that might not be an ideal situation to work in. And, er... Anyway, since about Christmas time, or just before Christmas, I've been noticeably stammering on the phone. It's funny this, because last year I was the fixture secretary of the local cricket club club so from about January to March time I'd be on the phone every night fixing up cricket matches so I used to quite enjoy it but I've developed a kind of dread of using the phone which is particularly severe at work. Perhaps it's because I'm in a wide open environment with plenty of people around. This is something I put in the questionnaire. You say, when are you most, I'm mixing about a bit here, when am I most fluent or whatever? And that is in a one-to-one situation as we are now. One-to-one with anybody. And particularly, I think, no observers either. If you and I were were the observers of it? What is your stutter? But it's bad for me. This is the thing. One of the problems, in fact, the real problem that worries me, it's not so much the repetition or the prolongations or whatever, it's the silent blocks that... I mean, I only learned this terminology this week, actually, because I'm quite into it now. Yeah, it's the silent blocks that... I think they're the ones that make me very apprehensive. If I was, for example, just sitting in a room and I wanted to say something, if, for example, somebody on the other side of the room had made some remark and I wanted to comment about it, or, I don't know, I tend to like making quite a few comments. People have trouble shutting me up most of the time when I get going. But if I wanted to make some reply, sometimes I tend to open my mouth and nothing comes out. That's very annoying. And in fact, I've put in the questionnaire. This happened once on the phone. I was something to do with a badminton match. I was supposed to be playing and then I had to ring up and cancel it. So I rang up the club captain. I spoke to his wife. She answered the phone. And I asked for Malcolm. And I think as I was saying it, I had a slight sort of stammer somewhere. Well, the way I tend to say, could I speak to him, I don't say... I mean, I can say it now, but I can't when I'm on the phone. You know what I mean? You know, like, could I speak to Malcolm? And it probably came out roughly right, but I imagine she would have recognised my voice.",

The last couple of seasons have been bad. This season, they're doing really well. We've brought in England stars. We've got 10 players from England in our squad, our first team. Our foreign is Mark Bostic, who's going to go. At the moment at school I'm doing my GCSEs. I chose Business Studies, Geography, Double Science, English, Maths, French, English, Literickshang, language. I'm doing all high papers in everything. So far, I've had my Geography. That went really well. I found that really easy. My RE, didn't do too well in that, because I couldn't really learn nothing. My maths, that was really hard. All the things I studied on didn't turn up or come up. And then on my technology, I learned everything. That was really hard. I didn't really understand all of it. And tomorrow I have maths and science again, same day as I had on Friday, I had maths and science then. Science I found out really easy, all multiple choices.

And then on the 1st of August, 3 o'clock in the morning, we piled our things into the car, strapped them down to the roof rack, and off we went in the direction of Poole. We ended up in a pool at about six o'clock in the morning and then two hours later after all the bags had been searched and all the other things, we were on board in our cabin. Maybe half the passengers on board were standing on deck waiting to see us move out. And we weren't going all that fast to begin with. And then another eight hours of pretty boring sea journey. At one point we thought we had sighted France when we passed New Jersey. Ah, really? Yes, and then we got into St. Marlow at about 4 o'clock on another car journey, which should have only taken three hours. But because we're not familiar with the countryside, it ended up five hours. And we arrived in the campsite at 9.15 French time. And that was our first night on the campsite. A few days later, I was swimming in the swimming pool, the open-air swimming pool of the campsite, just minding my own business, when I spotted a boy who had exactly the same make of goggles on and worn. And it also happened that we had jumped into the pool and landed almost side by side. After that, we'd become very good friends. And now we're pen pals. I think it was your friend. No, no, he was Scottish. Ah, right.",

At my school they've got Visual Basic and I sometimes up some of the techniques from that with all the add-ons and everything. It's really a very user-friendly language and easy to use. At home, I've actually got a higher version of Visual Basic than at school, but a computer sometimes crashes when it runs that. I think it's because of memory problems. And I've made some EXE versions of some of my games. But I'm keeping those to myself for the time. I might sell them later when I'm older. What sort of games have you written? Usually strategy games. I've written a programme where you've got to fill in some magic squares, and I've got a programme to actually make a magic square any size you want. Once I made one, 29 by 29, it took ages to fill in. That's the one where you move the... 29 by 29 looks impossible, but in fact it's based on one simple technique. Make it any size, as long as the dimension's an odd number. I haven't tried it with an even number yet. Oh, yes, visual basic. Most of my friends at school who are in years higher than me sometimes write programmes in Visual Basic and their lunch breaks. Some of them were a bit annoying, but I'd get used to that.

How was the studies? How was the studies? I found it quite interesting. We did specialised in economics and public administration. We did comparative politics and political philosophy and political sociology and that type of area, urban politics and sorts of subjects. Did you want to find a job related to your studies or you didn't mind doing something else afterwards? that I was certain of, but I would like to work in some field of administration. I would ultimately like to get into some form of administration or anage of some kind. that's the type of area interests as far as actually going into politics is concerned that would be although I'm interested in it would be quite hard as I've got as I have problems with my speech, you know. That's quite important. And in the present job you don't find a speech? It isn't too much of a problem. Sometimes I am with the people I work with. But sometimes I'm okay. It depends really. I find that I vary from time to time quite a lot depending on circumstances and how I react to stress has quite an effect on my speech also.

And does he have any explanation for the improvement in his speech? I think he's possibly become as he's got older he's become less self-conscious but apart from that I don't think he's got any specific observation to the reason why it seems to have cleared up. Do you think with you it can happen the same way? about completely clearing up. I think there's a chance that it could improve as I get older.

    "transcription": " a wealthy Athenian, instead of paying taxes for a single year, you could either choose to organise a religious procession, you could make a warship, or you could sponsor a Greek playwright in the Greek theatre and you'd have to organise everything including the costumes and you'd have to train the chorus. There were many differences between Greek theatre and theatre these days. There were only three actors in general. There was a main actor and there were two supporting actors. And they tended to switch roles all the time. As a result, all the costumes they wore tended to be pretty heavy but easy to get on and off. Those were all masks which gave them a whole new identity from the point of view of the audience and it also meant that all the people who were sitting at the back of the theatre could see them. Yeah, this obviously doesn't happen these days because they were relatively small theatres. This is because any single play will often be showed hundreds of times instead of in ancient times when any single play was only shown once, it had only one main performance. The actors in Greece were all male, whereas these days there were female actors as well. However, absolutely anyone was allowed to come and see the performances. They were very keen on encouraging people to get involved with the theatre, which meant that if you couldn't afford to pay the entrance fee, they had to have a government grant, which these days you don't have. The role of the chorus. There were 12 or 15 people in a chorus, if it was a comic play, and up to 24 if it was a tragedy. The chorus acted in the orchestra, which was a wide open space, rather than the meaning it's adopted these days. Their roles were they often commented upon the action of the three main actors often acting as often acting as some of their slaves. They would sing and dance as well and were accompanied by an alertes which means a flute player once the chorus entered the stage they didn't usually leave and they usually acted as a single group so they had no individuality they wore the same all the same masks and the same clothes um",
