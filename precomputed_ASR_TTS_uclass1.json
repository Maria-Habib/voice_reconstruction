What I've been doing is I've been sailing most of the time in wave areas which are really quite big boats and what it is, it is quite hard to actually steer a boat because you've got two jobs to do, to actually make sure where you're going and also look at how much wind you've got. And what you have to wear, you have to wear like clothes to keep you warm. So what I wear is I wear a wetsuit on top of that which I wear a life jacket and then what I wear on my feet is I wear wetsuit boots. What you have to do is you also have to learn how to rig a boat, which is actually quite hard because you've got all all these like pieces of ropes and things which you have to mumble so what the first thing you the first thing you do is you put on one of the two sails which the wayfarer has what they have they have one big sail then i have a then then they have a really much smaller sale called called the um called the um jib and what then what they do they have a much bigger sale called the um called the um main sale which is which is much much bigger than the jib so what you do is you put the jib on and then what you do is you put the mainsail up and then and then what you do is you take",

I started off on Foil and that was okay but I didn't feel it was as interesting as some of the others so I started doing a bit of epa after a while and in epa you've got to hit your opponent with the end of the sword absolutely anywhere basically and it's all done with computers and you're all wired up to stuff which can tell if you've hit the other person or not. And there's a metal floor often which means that light doesn't come up if you hit the floor. And I've entered a few competitions. I did quite well. About a year ago when I came 7th in Surrey which wasn't bad. I haven't been doing it so much recently though but I have done a bit of sabre. Most of our school fencing competitions are sabre rather than lappe which is a bit of a pain because it's mostly those of inexperienced people who just hit you and I was wake up the next day with all these bruises and bleeding a bit I've entered a couple of saber competitions as well I'm not generally very good at saber because I don't really practice it but once I got to the last 16 of the public schools fencing competition, which I thought wasn't bad. I don't think I'm realistically going to be able to keep fencing up at university because there's other things that I probably want to do instead. I'm not sure I'll have the time. But I'll probably enter the public schools again this year.",

It's sort of a cross between a mountain bike and a racer, which is ideal for my needs, because I live in fairly rough terrain, where I'd like to go out on long rides. And it's a great replacement for my old mountain bike, because that's in bits. Well, almost. How does that work? There's a magnet on one of the wheels, and there's a sensor, and you have to tell it there's a conference of your wheels, but I haven't worked that out yet, so it turns when I do 10 miles and in fact I only do 8 actually on the road but I'll get that sorted. Oh yeah and it's got this nice feature, well it's got average speed and time so that... Well, if you're at a traffic light, it automatically stops so that you can not waste extra time getting your average speed down to zero. And I haven't seen that feature in a lot of cycle computers. My first real practical use of a cycle computer was last week when I went on a bike ride to see one of my friends. It's meant to be about eight miles, so it took about 10 on the computer. It was the longest bike ride I've ever been on, and it was on my own.",

The first half of it means many, and next means faces, so it means many faces, literally. The last one I've made is a rhombocube octahedron, which is like a cube, only it's got some triangles on all the corners, and it's evened out, no sharp points. Before that, I made a dodecahedron, dodeca meaning 12 hedron faces again, which is different from a dodecagon, which is only 2D shaped with 12 sides. And they do actually look quite different. I started this in the summer holidays last year when I got bored. All you really need is a piece of cardboard from a cereal packet, a pencil, ruler, protractor, pencil sharpener, razor maybe. One of the first ones I made was a basic cube. And you just put flaps everywhere and then join them up with the glue. After that I started making up my own shapes which didn't always work. I once made like a cross like that and it had a piece in the middle. It's like a 3D cross. And that almost turned out right. But I think it's a physical impossibility because you don't have enough area on the card, so you'd have to make it more than one piece. So the aim is to always make these out of single sheets? I do my best. Sometimes I have to use more than one, like in that case. But I didn't know them because I just made it up.",

I work as a production controller on and off the oil platform. That means I control everything that goes on onboard the oil platform. How much oil we bring onboard, how much of everything, all the control actions that are required, that's what I do. So you're actually on the board all the time, it's a ship, it's a big... When I say on board, that's just a nautical expression, it doesn't move, it's nailed into the seabed, it doesn't move.

Except I've not always worked with oil, directly with oil, which I do now. It's always been in the associated industries. And sort of all the offshoots you get from the oil industry. The gas and chemicals and various things. I'm willing to continue it. I work away from home. I work away for 14 days, then I'm home for 14 days. I'm reasonably happy doing it, as happy as, I suppose, any job. It's hard going away from home. But once I actually get into work, it's OK. But it's just hard to get there. But what does it say? Once I'm there, I'm there. Like we had in the army. Probably. Was you in the army? Yeah. Oh, of course, yeah. So we also went for 14 days and then came home for a weekend and went again. It's hard going back, isn't it? Yeah, it's very hard. But once you're back, it's okay. Yeah. It's the same with me. I can remember this feeling. And you're married, you have kids also? Yeah, I'm married. I have three daughters. Do you want their ages? Yeah. Age 13. She was just 13 this month. One's 11 and the other one, she's 9. That's it. And you have brothers, sisters? I have three brothers, yeah? And you are the oldest? And tell me, was there someone in your family that you know of, you've heard in the history, that you used to stutter? And you know a you know, you had therapy before? I went, I imagine when I was about eight years old, up to about 14. And just about half an hour a week. And when I got to 14, she said, that's it, you're discharged. And she'd not done anything for me. I think now, in retrospect, I think, you see, when I was eight, I didn't know I had a stammer. I've no doubt my mother noticed it, and in school they must have noticed it. But I never noticed it until I got to secondary school age, which is 11. When I went to secondary school, it just hit me all of a sudden. It was, I don't know, it was just like an overnight thing. Now, I don't know why, because the school was in the area where I lived, so it was not unfamiliar. I knew boys who went to the school, so I wasn't on my own, you know. I don't know why. It all hit me within the first week of going to secondary school. And it was a school that I wanted to go to. It was not sort of enforced on me. I wanted to go to that school. I don't know why. It just hit me all in one week. One week I could speak. I was absolutely unconcerned about my speech. And the next week I could hardly speak. Very interesting. Yeah. So the whole pattern of speech change immediately? say up to going to that school I would read out in the class I would do anything the moment went to this school I would know I couldn't answer my name I couldn't repeat my name I don't know why I really don't know I've analyzed this and over and over again nothing happened at home we didn't we didn't move house okay we didn't move going, it's it called, they have an association or something. I've forgotten the name of it. They have some national association with stammerers. Well, it wasn't advertised. It had an article on TV on the local news. Like about half past six in the evening you have a local news. And they just happened to mention this and there's an interview of the leader of this association. They said they're having a meeting in Manchester. Well, I live near Manchester anyway. It was on the following day, so I went into Manchester, heard what they had to say, and then they referred me. They asked for all our names if we'd not had a therapy, had any therapy. I was referred to a speech therapist near me. She heard me. She said, I don't think you have a stammer because of all my avoidance. I said, well, I can assure you I have got one. And she said, well, I will refer you off to this place.",

Well, not really young, but some children of eight and all that in there, so it took a while for them to learn it. But eventually we did all of the dance. Then after that there was Jungle Book.

I don't know who's it is personally because I've lived... well, because it's her normal voice to me ever since I was born. If you actually branch, which was three years in Cambridge. Well, come April I will have been three years in Cambridge. Prior to that I lived for five years in Edinburgh. I did my first degree there. It's a great place. Yes, it is a very nice place to live actually. The only snag is it's quite cold in the winter months and there's usually quite a strong wind which sort of character, it's like Jerusalem, it's parts of Europe in different years. And then I'd return to it, to Edinburgh, and see it again like a tourist would see it for the first time. I think, ah, I mean, it's absolutely amazing here. It is. And do you like to do hobbies or things in your free time? because I'm trying to write up my PhD as fast as possible. But when I do have time, I used to play the classical guitar, but I've lapsed quite a lot now. But I still occasionally play it, just to keep a few of the most basic pieces going. Apart from that, well, I quite often like to go out to the cinema or to the theatre or something like that. I used to have quite a lot of hobbies at school, painting and drawing. I used to play several different musical instruments and things. But then gradually, as I went playing so much. I still have this sight for the future that I'll to play the clarinet in my school orchestra. The problem was that the school orchestra used to play rather boring music, old Irish folk tunes. the music teacher was quite old and dodgy and just liked the sort of old Irish folk tunes and things. So we used to have to play these sort of rather boring pieces of music. So I stopped going to it. And then my lessons were stopped as a reprisal. But I still have my clarinet but I haven't played it for ten years or something. Which in the the case of the clarinet, is quite bad because on a few occasions that I have tried to play again, it's very hard to get the breathing right. I mean, I only need to play it for two minutes and I'm out of breath. It's terrible. Yes. Well, yes, and I have to try and find some soft reeds again, because at this stage, when I left playing off, playing the clarinet, I only had hard reeds, and of course it's quite hard to play on a hard reed if you haven't played for a while. So it's all blowing noises and then squeaks. So I just tend to give up now. you can't play nicer, but it has more potential, I think, also social, and they could. It's harmonic instrument, it's harmonic rather than playing single notes at a time. But, well, for a while after I left the school orchestra, because I thought the music which they played was rather boring, so I took up playing jazz on the planet, well, not very well, and so I used to play with some other people who were interested in playing jazz. And that was a very good fun. I mean, it was the first time that I'd actually enjoyed, really enjoyed playing. Prior to that, it had just been something which I sort of was forced to do as part of my school lessons and something. Because I actually asked to play the bassoon, but they wouldn't let me play the bassoon until I learned the clarinet first, you see, which is what I was playing. So I had to learn an instrument which at first I didn't really want to play knowledge. It's a lot easier to play jazz on the clarinet than on the guitar, because on the guitar you're thinking about chord structures and all kinds of things. And I mean, we played a very, very simple jazz, not a complicated sort of Dixieland or traditional jazz more. I don't know where we got the tunes from but they were sort of a bit slower and it was quite easy since they were sort of like recurring chord sequences and so on, one eventually after you'd played it for a while, you know, I mean you can even start off with three notes or something and then you eventually find a whole range of possible notes. Well, you obviously start off by trying to play the tune, which is reasonably easy. And then from that, I just used to use, at first first other notes from the same tune and jumble them up basically and then after you played the same piece several times you found whole sequences which would occur so that you could play. And it became quite easy because you then had quite a large repertoire. I mean, you sort of knew all of other notes which you could use. Which in the clan, that's not terribly difficult because there are only a limited number of notes and a reasonably limited number of notes. So it was actually quite easy to pick up early.",

Do you have hobbies that you really like to devote yourself to? I have to study in the world? I'm familiar with certain areas. I mean, there are things which just don't really interest me. I tend to be more interested in things regarding the economics side of things and also European and American affairs. But I don't really know much about African affairs or Middle Eastern affairs. You know about our economic situation? I know you have very, very high inflation. Yes. It's enormous. Yes. I think that if you buy a cup of coffee, you can have to pay a high price than you anticipated, is that right? Yeah. That could happen? There were times that prices were increased every day, you know, it was amazing. You couldn't pay in a day. But now they had sort of an agreement that for three months, say, they want to increase the prices of products, which makes life a bit easier. But it's a great problem, it's a really great problem. One cannot see a solution to it. Do you have very much unemployment in Israel? really occupied and receiving salary, but they don't do too much on their own. At the moment we don't have high rate of unemployment, but I suppose it's inevitable, it will be. In the near future they will start to get people out of jobs, it's very often. But political situation is also a great problem in our country. And did you visit other places in the world a lot, or not so much? With your work I Do you have parents still alive? Yes, my parents are alive. They live in Market Harbour. I have two sisters. One sister is married. She lives in Birmingham. One sister is doing linguistics at university in North Wales. So you're the only one? How is it to be a sandwich? Why do you think he would find more common language with your brother? And she does do anything linguistics you really like? And it's only half and half. Did you know him? For example, if he makes a telephone call, the first few words he would repeat himself a lot. But nobody else, no. And when he repeats, is it on full words or only parts of words? Parts of words, yeah. So it's more stuttering in nature, because when one repeats on a whole word, it's not so know before? I suppose like most of the st about it and you do try and hide it. In more recent years I've tried not to do that and I think that's beneficial in itself. But I find by and large that I can avoid stuttering if I want to, just by psyching myself up, I suppose. What do you mean? Is it a slant, psyching myself up? Yes. I suppose by creating a certain tension, perhaps. But then it has to be released in a sense. That's right, that's right. I found when I lived at home, when I went home at night, I started far more at home when I was relaxed than I did during the daytime. Whereas now that I'm away from home, then there's no time to relax like that. You don't just flop down in that way. So maybe that's why my stutter's worse now, perhaps when I was at home. Do you think if you weigh these two things, not to stutter and to be not so relaxed, build up of tension, as opposed to stutter and be more relaxed, what do you think? Well, it's not really a case of what's preferable. It's just the way it happens. I think you never ever want to stutter if you can do. It's just that for some reason I stutter at home and I don't stutter when I'm in the company of other people perhaps, or not so often. But there's no... You don't suddenly say to yourself, well, I will stutter or I mean, I stutter sometimes when I'm in very tension situations, like many people I guess. So, at first I used to be sometimes embarrassed about it because it doesn't, I mean, I didn't like it to be stuttered. But then I was very happy about it because as a speech therapist I really want to experience more. And I really treasure these moments when I stutter because for me it's very important to really... You're actually trying to become a speech therapist? Oh, you are now? Yes. Oh, I hadn't realised that. Yes. Yes. Have you ever practiced as a speech therapist or not? kinds of things. So we were specialized in each field. But it was for short periods of time. And I miss it. I mean, I really want to experience more proper speech therapy job. But being here, it's sometimes difficult because of the work permit situation. But at least I can do some research and speak to people. And I really think it's very important to contribute a lot to actually. I think one of the good things about it is that it's not very pressurized. It's a very relaxing job. Whereas a lot of jobs nowadays, especially my job, is extremely pressurised. There's time pressure on you to get jobs done by a certain date. Whereas in your job, there's no time pressure at all.",

Arts quite fun though, because it's not really that intense, so it's quite good. Although I've still got to do quite a bit on that, so I don't know. IT, that's up and down. It can be okay, but it can be really dull talking about sort of sounds from Inputs and outputs of computers and everything that bits a bit too technical really. Other than that it's fine.",

To have this position, you either have to have a degree or you can have been recommended from other grades of officer. I entered into the civil service in 1971 with eight Old devils and four old devils. I have since worked in about three or four different offices but all in the Birmingham area. It's a fairly interesting job if you like figure work. And the people who I currently deal with are self-employed people such as builders, electricians, bookmakers, then there would be self-employed accountants and teachers, estate agents, solicitors, electricians, taxi drivers, carpet fitters, What are your expectations afterwards? Where do you like to walk exactly after you finish the training course? heard but I do not know exactly where I shall get transferred to. It could be down in London or it could be say Hereford or it could be anywhere. If it was in London the trouble would be the price of housing which is very high. Also I do feel when I come down to London that the pace of life is very fast in comparison to other areas. Although, even though I say that, it is an interesting place from the historical point of view. And when I compare Birmingham with this place, there is no comparison at all. The inner city in Birmingham How old is London? If you have a look at England as a whole, the only cities which have got any real interest are either Edinburgh in Scotland or London. Even though some of these other cities might have a few old churches and town halls and that sort of thing they haven't got a lot else to offer also even if you looked at the these theaters in London there's a lot of theatres. In Birmingham there's only three, which are only very small anyway, in comparison to London. So from the entertainment point of view it is extremely restricted. Birmingham is an industrial city with some large manufacturing industries such as austium rover cars. They also make parts for aeroplanes and extra things which I can't offhand think about. But it is an industrial city. It is an industrial city. Tell me something, I was wondering, what is the process when you catch somebody who didn't pay taxes, broke the law in some extent in your area? What happens to him once he's caught? and we have found them out we will have to ask him if he accepts the figures if he does accept the figures we then go on from there to begin with we would we would then find out how much income tax is due upon that income then he would also be charged a figure of interest upon that tax also he would have to pay a penalty now the penalty alters with the degree of culpability if he has been fraudulent the penalty is a lot higher than if he's only just been neglectful so we charge him the tax some interest upon that and a penalty then and we've got all three he has to make an offer to pay those figures. After he pays the offer, well, after he signs the form, he's got 30 days in which time to actually make the offer. And if he does that, there isn't going to be any further action. Offhand, we would only send people to prison where it was a case of fraud, when they had been very, very bad. And now moving to a very different subject, what",

I'm in all those teams apart from athletics which I don't really like. In rugby I play inside centre which is really kind of a forward but helps at the back as well. Midfield, if you're talking football wise. In football I'm a defender and I play for the school team as well in cricket I'm not really a bowler but I can bowl quite well quite accurately I'm more of a batter and my favourite bat is the V600 by Schlesinger at school my favourite subject is science and I like that because you get to find out a wide variety of things. I like maths quite a lot as well, I don't know why I just like it. And my worst subject is probably English or Latin. I don't like Latin because it's very hard and English I'm just not very good at.

    "transcription": " Why are you in such a late stage? really, I suppose you'd say, to an extent where I seem to be thinking about, well, at the moment I feel quite relaxed, because I'm with Nearest at the moment. But I find at times I tend to become so preoccupied with it that I can't think of anything else but my stammer. This has happened over the last couple of months. And I tend to get... It's as though I'm going around in circles trying to work out what to do. I'm thinking about the next conversation I'm going to make. Is this the kind of thing you're after? Yes, I mean... Yeah? Because usually, I mean, you're the first man I've ever seen, man, woman stutter. And in fact, I think I'm speaking more deliberately and slowly at the moment, but in general, I tend to speak quite quickly apparently. I mean, it doesn't seem quick to me. At the moment, this seems quite slow. I'll probably speak more quickly than this, but I'm perhaps taking time to consider what I'm saying. And people usually in your life, I'm the sort of person who prefers to, if I was doing some work, for example, writing an essay or whatever, I'd need complete quiet. Something like this place right at the moment. You know, and there's some people apparently who can work, you know, with Radio 1 on, with the Top 20 or cassette music, but, you know, I like quiet, so I thought that might, you know, be a... that might not be an ideal situation to work in. And, er... Anyway, since about Christmas time, or just before Christmas, I've been noticeably stammering on the phone. It's funny this, because last year I was the fixture secretary of the local cricket club club so from about January to March time I'd be on the phone every night fixing up cricket matches so I used to quite enjoy it but I've developed a kind of dread of using the phone which is particularly severe at work. Perhaps it's because I'm in a wide open environment with plenty of people around. This is something I put in the questionnaire. You say, when are you most, I'm mixing about a bit here, when am I most fluent or whatever? And that is in a one-to-one situation as we are now. One-to-one with anybody. And particularly, I think, no observers either. If you and I were were the observers of it? What is your stutter? But it's bad for me. This is the thing. One of the problems, in fact, the real problem that worries me, it's not so much the repetition or the prolongations or whatever, it's the silent blocks that... I mean, I only learned this terminology this week, actually, because I'm quite into it now. Yeah, it's the silent blocks that... I think they're the ones that make me very apprehensive. If I was, for example, just sitting in a room and I wanted to say something, if, for example, somebody on the other side of the room had made some remark and I wanted to comment about it, or, I don't know, I tend to like making quite a few comments. People have trouble shutting me up most of the time when I get going. But if I wanted to make some reply, sometimes I tend to open my mouth and nothing comes out. That's very annoying. And in fact, I've put in the questionnaire. This happened once on the phone. I was something to do with a badminton match. I was supposed to be playing and then I had to ring up and cancel it. So I rang up the club captain. I spoke to his wife. She answered the phone. And I asked for Malcolm. And I think as I was saying it, I had a slight sort of stammer somewhere. Well, the way I tend to say, could I speak to him, I don't say... I mean, I can say it now, but I can't when I'm on the phone. You know what I mean? You know, like, could I speak to Malcolm? And it probably came out roughly right, but I imagine she would have recognised my voice.",

We stayed there for about one week. There's a swimming pool there. There's loads of good facilities as well. Also I went to Menorca, that was for also one week. It was about 90 degrees out there and the sea was quite warm. We were on the beach most of the time in the swimming pool which was quite warm. We were on the beach most of the time and in the swimming pool which was quite cold. I stayed in an apartment in Menorca in somewhere called Kalembosch which we went to last year. When we came back from Menorca we went to last year. We went straight off to Alton Towers for two nights. The first day we went to Birmingham, we went to somewhere called the Bass Museum which is a beer brewing place and that was quite good and second they actually went to Alton Towers and there were lots of good rides there there was Nemesis, Oblivion and loads of other rides I went on Nemesis and it was enjoyable. Becky, my sister, chickened out on it. She didn't want to go on it. It was a long journey back home though. It was about a two hour journey in the car and there was traffic on the way back down the M40. It was a big traffic jam so we were in that for about half an hour going through London. Then we went to pick the car up from the kennels the next day. And he was a little excited. How old's your sister? The one who chickened out the...",

And then on the 1st of August, 3 o'clock in the morning, we piled our things into the car, strapped them down to the roof rack, and off we went in the direction of Poole. We ended up in a pool at about six o'clock in the morning and then two hours later after all the bags had been searched and all the other things, we were on board in our cabin. Maybe half the passengers on board were standing on deck waiting to see us move out. And we weren't going all that fast to begin with. And then another eight hours of pretty boring sea journey. At one point we thought we had sighted France when we passed New Jersey. Ah, really? Yes, and then we got into St. Marlow at about 4 o'clock on another car journey, which should have only taken three hours. But because we're not familiar with the countryside, it ended up five hours. And we arrived in the campsite at 9.15 French time. And that was our first night on the campsite. A few days later, I was swimming in the swimming pool, the open-air swimming pool of the campsite, just minding my own business, when I spotted a boy who had exactly the same make of goggles on and worn. And it also happened that we had jumped into the pool and landed almost side by side. After that, we'd become very good friends. And now we're pen pals. I think it was your friend. No, no, he was Scottish. Ah, right.",

And I've made some EXE versions of some of my games. But I'm keeping those to myself for the time. I might sell them later when I'm older. What sort of games have you written? Usually strategy games. I've written a programme where you've got to fill in some magic squares, and I've got a programme to actually make a magic square any size you want. Once I made one, 29 by 29, it took ages to fill in. That's the one where you move the... 29 by 29 looks impossible, but in fact it's based on one simple technique. Make it any size, as long as the dimension's an odd number. I haven't tried it with an even number yet. Oh, yes, visual basic. Most of my friends at school who are in years higher than me sometimes write programmes in Visual Basic and their lunch breaks. Some of them were a bit annoying, but I'd get used to that.

    "transcription": " a wealthy Athenian, instead of paying taxes for a single year, you could either choose to organise a religious procession, you could make a warship, or you could sponsor a Greek playwright in the Greek theatre and you'd have to organise everything including the costumes and you'd have to train the chorus. There were many differences between Greek theatre and theatre these days. There were only three actors in general. There was a main actor and there were two supporting actors. And they tended to switch roles all the time. As a result, all the costumes they wore tended to be pretty heavy but easy to get on and off. Those were all masks which gave them a whole new identity from the point of view of the audience and it also meant that all the people who were sitting at the back of the theatre could see them. Yeah, this obviously doesn't happen these days because they were relatively small theatres. This is because any single play will often be showed hundreds of times instead of in ancient times when any single play was only shown once, it had only one main performance. The actors in Greece were all male, whereas these days there were female actors as well. However, absolutely anyone was allowed to come and see the performances. They were very keen on encouraging people to get involved with the theatre, which meant that if you couldn't afford to pay the entrance fee, they had to have a government grant, which these days you don't have. The role of the chorus. There were 12 or 15 people in a chorus, if it was a comic play, and up to 24 if it was a tragedy. The chorus acted in the orchestra, which was a wide open space, rather than the meaning it's adopted these days. Their roles were they often commented upon the action of the three main actors often acting as often acting as some of their slaves. They would sing and dance as well and were accompanied by an alertes which means a flute player once the chorus entered the stage they didn't usually leave and they usually acted as a single group so they had no individuality they wore the same all the same masks and the same clothes um",

That's one bed and two on the bunk bed so that was pretty dire and it got really hot at times but it was it's very nice place in Russell. We spent a whole day shopping. Prices there are quite cheap compared to England. The main reason we were there was for competition. We were in Poland for only a week and the competition was on two days. So we had a fair bit of time to go around, see the sights and all that. I didn't get much Polish out because it didn't really seem worth learning a lot of it but I learned a few phrases which were useful. What else did we do? Only three people from my college went and about 14 from England because it was an international competition. So we did a fair bit of socialising with people from other countries. At the end of the week, some people had an international football match, which was basically all people from the UK versus everyone else and apparently they lost which sounds fairly plausible. What else to say? They've got really good public transport in Poland because obviously well in Warsaw in particular because after the whole place was bombed in the Second World War they had it completely rebuilt and obviously had the time to think about it so they've got really wide roads on an average road in Walsall you'll get about two or three lanes of traffic and a couple of wide pavements and some tram lines down the middle.

Although this is only usually played in the winter season, so we stopped a few weeks ago. And apart from that, I like listening to music and have a guitar at home, though I can't play it very well. What kind of music are you listening to? Well, most sorts usually. Not classical or things like that. Pop. It's fairly varied actually. I mean you have to take care of it? That's right, it's a VW Golf, it's about 6 years old. It's like a Beetle or it's... I don't know cars so well. No, it's about the size of a Fiesta. It's a small hatchback type car. It seems fairly reliable though. I'm saving it for a music centre at the moment. It's supposed to be fairly reliable with the rust and things like that. I've been driving about two and a half years now, so... Driving? Driving. I passed my test about two and a half years ago, yeah. That's good. When did you pass then? I passed my test nearly two years ago, just before I came here. And here I didn't dare drive. Once I took my father's car and tried, but it was probably not good. Did you drive on the left side or the right side over there? We drive on the... I want to say the right side, but we drive on the opposite side. Yeah. But, I mean, our drivers doesn't have a reputation of good drivers, but, I mean, it's nicer to drive at home, you know, you're used to this side. That's right. You're used to all these sort of signs, aren't you? I don't know if they have a roundabout at all. Really? Yeah. What's on the back? I don't know if they have a little roundabout. Have you been around the world? How come you chose this specific job you are doing now a course? Did they send you to a couple of courses? No, not really. Just whether you'll be able to cope with not very complicated or hard work. So that wasn't bad anyway. What size of the work would you like? It's only a small company you see. So you know everyone there. So everyone is really nice there. It's varied, it's not just one thing you're doing at the moment. My job is, we own a certain amount of equipment ourselves. When we repair our customers equipment, we loan them our equipment. I have to know who we've loaned them to, where it is, you see. So that's a fairly varied and interesting work, I suppose. So you meet a lot of people? Yeah, quite a few people, yeah. And I think being a stutterer, did they change something in your attitude towards your job? I mean? Would you do something different? Would you go to some other field? What kind of a job would you look for? You're repairing all kinds of computers? Sorry? You're repairing all kinds of computers? Well, yeah, about five or six sorts of. The microcomputers, not the sort of large mainframes. The main producers we repair are IBM and Apple and Apricot and Sirius.",

I don't know about the FA Cup but he has scored a lot of goals for Arsenal so that's why he's my favourite player. My second favourite player is Robert Perez.

So first tell me about what aspects of your job you are more interested in. What bits of the job you really like to do? It's a very social and sociable industry. The people, as I say, meeting them and talking with them about radio, LBC, myself, their self, what they did over the weekend, it's very or pally and very nice and very friendly. Also within the office that I? Meeting with the job, meet more people and enjoy it more. And has it ever interfered with you getting to meet new people and feeling free to speak with think about that? What hobbies do you like to do after job? It's actually a lot of lectures because most of the courses do about 13-14 hours a week on each course. It doesn't sound an awful lot on its own but bear in mind that you're working 35 hours a week plus lunch plus getting to and from work. I often try to do things from Monday to Friday and then have the weekend off. It doesn't always work out that way of course.",

    "transcription": " You didn't know this story before? No. If you can still hold it, close your mouth the same way, and I'll ask a couple of questions. Oh, yes, yes. You can ask me also a couple of questions. Something is not alright there. Oh, no. Are you used to reading? I mean, it doesn't bother you to read? You write a lot? No, I don't. It's just now and then. Or it's not, or at least I don't write I don't write a large amount of stuff. It's just a rough note which I've gradually accumulated. How long were the courses you took at the college in Manchester? The course in Manchester was for three years and the course have a second degree from the Royal College? And illustrations, is it in graphics? Well, illustration is more concerned with making drawings and images, whereas the graphics tends to be more concerned with the layout. But they overlap a good deal anyway. My main asset is in drawing really, an ability to draw. So illustration seems like the obvious thing to go in for. You paint a lot. Yes, well, I draw more than paint. I'm trying to do more painting recently, well, over the past couple of years because I hadn't really used colour a great studies, who used to do illustrations and drawings. I mean, what are sort of examples for you? drawings of George Gross who uh... Gil Ray, who was an 18th century British illustrator. And Rawlinson, who was working at the same time. I like them. I can't think of many others actually. We're not illustrators, you know, I'm more interested in the painters really than the illustrators. I like David Hockney. I like his drawings. And apart from that, Renaissance painters. Mantegna is one of my favourites. And Piero della Francesca. In fact, I'm more interested in those than in illustrators, really. That's why I don't know much about illustrators. That's why I can't remember. Have you been to the Chag is a bit too jarring. And it was a lovely program. I think one of the things to enjoy Chagall is to be more involved with his way at least part-time teaching in art schools. I don't have that, no. And I haven't actually done any teaching. It's not a thing which I've ever really seriously considered. Can I ask you about your family? Do you have brothers, sisters? Yes, I've got two sisters. One of them lives in Plymouth, where my parents live. The other lives in London. And you are in the middle? No, I'm the eldest. So it's nice to have a sister nearby. Yes. And your parents are working in Plymouth or in Pension now? My father works in Plymouth. Although... Although... He's meant... Although... He's retiring this year. I think he's anyway. He's not quite sure about that. But he's at retiring age. Or near retiring age. So it'll be just this year then then you're just he doesn't want to stay on i think he'll be quite glad to retire and he works in the top five internet here he's connected with that It's a very industrial part of the town, isn't it? Yeah, I remember passing through this town. And your mother used to work at home? And you're not married? And do you know of someone in the family who used to stutter heavy or sort of wait? Since what? Since when did you start speaking? Could it be that it started earlier, but you became have noticed it and would have asked me why I was stammering. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, well, I think in my case, it might have become apparent that it wasn't just a phase but it was continuing. And did it interfere with you doing things that you wished to do? I mean, would you choose another profession or go to study a different thing in college? Well, I think I might have considered going in for teaching, which I've never really considered, because I think that having a speech impediment wouldn used to teach lectures as well. I mean, I had a lecture as well. It was a very good lecture. It was one of but it's a thing which tends to be repeated to a certain extent. It's easier. Because I'm not so bad when I'm reading out things. Although I used to be. I used to hate doing that at school when I had to read out in front of the class. But that's not so bad now. Or maybe it's because it's not a thing which I have to do now. Whereas at the time at school it was a thing which I was expected to do. And so it was the idea that I had to do it. And I think i was into that as well yes",

    "transcription": " My favourite sport is football because it keeps me really fit. I used to play for a football team. Now I don't because there is no football teams around my area. I chose football as my favourite hobby because it involves some skills that you need to learn. It also helps you keep fit and make your brain work more actively. My other hobbies are cricket rounders because they all involve running and hitting. But my favourite one is Rounders because it has a thin, long bat that is hard to hold up and is thin because it needs to hit harder. The ball is fatter than the bat. Cricket is much nicer because it has a fatter bat and a smaller ball but the bats are heavy and you need to have a lot of strength to hold a bat. You need also to have a hard hitting skills. It also needs you to be a fast runner and a good aimer. Horse riding is also good because you improve on your skills on how to be confident with a horse. You also jump over some poles.",
